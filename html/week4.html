        <h2>Week 4</h2>
        <p>Hello, and welcome to the Week 4 blog, 
            this week we mainly spoke about Database Design and Security Aspects. 
            Unfortunately, we still have not seen our sponsor at this point, 
            still keeping up hope that we would manage to see them on the hackathon week.
            In the meanwhile, we started with the basic database design, and at the bottom as shown. 
            I have drawn out the needed tables, such as Employee, Shift and Record.
            With Employee having columns such EmployeeID, ShiftID, Name. 
            Where both Record and Shift, having In and Out (being time), in Record, 
            it records each Entry/Exit with the employee's TimeIn/Out.
            While for Shift, it shows the Expected TimeIn/Out of a shift.
            Each Record is tied to its employeeID, and each employeeID has a ShiftID associated.
            The below picture explains our database in a better way.
            On the other hand, we are using Microsoft SQL Server, we would be doing some Database Security, 
            to avoid situations where the Tableau console is compromised (credential leaks), and someone would gain 
            access to the entire database.
            So we are planning to secure the Database Administrators account (SA) with a secret password, as well 
            as stronger credential on the Data Analyst's end as well, we also limit the user to only view, 
            Database Views, which are essentially tables that cannot be changed, in addition we only allow SELECT privileges
            on this account.
            <br><br>
            Next week is the real deal, with the hackathon, where all teams and all classes will be working in parallel,
            for 2 and a half days! I really so hope our sponsors show up during the hackathon, to provide us with some help
            and much needed support. <br>
            <b>EDIT: AIDC has offered to give us Instances of PHP, Linux and MySQL, we are going to move to MySQL, after we finalize our database.</b>
