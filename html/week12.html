        <h2>Week 12</h2>
        <p>
           Hello, and welcome back to my blog. Happy new year, to anyone who is reading this currently.
           Since the alloted PFD timing for this week is during a public break, we have decided to do a 
           teams call and discuss about a few aspects of the project. Mainly, the switching of technologies
           and discussion of technological aspects and feasability. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Previously, after the presentation of our solution to our stakeholders at AIDC, we realised that
            other teams did have a lot of front-end UI facing applications, and after votes and decisions, we
            decided to make an administrator's console, using a full stack application, made in <a href="https://asp.net">ASP.NET</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/">C#</a>,
            (since that is what most of our group is used to). I was thinking of a solution, (if we do have access to the bare Console of the Instance),
            where MySQL would be hosted on AIDC's end, and would be used to interface between the 
            <a href="./break.html">PHP Endpoint</a> and the <a href="https://asp.net">ASP.NET</a> application, it could be done using routing of the web server
            such as <a href="https://www.nginx.com/">NGINX</a> or <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/">The Apache HTTP Server</a>.
            For the analysis of data using Tableau, are thinking of enabling an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunneling_protocol">SSH tunnel</a>
            to open a route from the instance to the data analyst's computer. Then we will feed data directly to Tableau from the MySQL database.
        </p>
        <p>
            For next week, our team will be starting on using ASP.NET and starting integration with our local
            MySQL instance, and I will be working on getting the Raspberry Pi up and running, getting it hooked up
            to the internet and updated, and hopefully running the gantry software again. See you next week.
        </p>
