        <h2>Week 2</h2>
        <p>Welcome back to my Week 2 Blog for my PFD (Portfolio Development) Class.
            First of all, we needed to go through the IBM EDT (Enterprise Design Thinking) course this week.
            Although, for my Dell InnovateFest competiton, I had already attempted this certification last semester.
            It is basically about how you can help your team innovate and design better, by use of design thinking,
            empathy and others. Other than that, this week, me and my team has learned the concept of the inception deck.
            Where it is a small pitch to the sponsors and others, including points such as the plan for the project, 
            estimated time durations and others. We called via Microsoft Teams in order to complete the inception deck and 
            submitted it on time, discussing about details, such as a brand new logo that I have put in the bottom.
            During the period after the learning of the inception deck, we discussed a concept where we are using new 
            RFID gantries such as the ones used in the carpark. Those uses an RS232 interface which has a high voltage level (15v)
            compared to the hardware that we have acquired from Mr Ben (Our PFD Lecturer), the Raspberry Pi (tolerates to 5v). 
            So we would have to use an RS232 to USB adapter to feed the communications into the Pi. The concept drawing 
            shown below is a rough overview of the final product, while the one boxed in is the 'core' aspect while the ones 
            outside are the additional aspects. So when a user crosses the gantry, record will be stored and speaker will speak your name. 
            The record is stored in a (hopefully) AWS RDS (Relational Database System) instance on the cloud. We also came up with a list of items that we 
            have put in the Excel file, for which items we would need to procure.
            </p>
            <p>Thank you so much for listening. See you guys next week.</p>
